# High-Fidelity Flow Characterization in a Water Channel

## Summary

This project investigated flow behavior around a physical model in a controlled water channel environment. The goal was to characterize flow structures, validate scaling assumptions, and compare experimental results to theoretical predictions.

## Experimental Setup

- Recirculating water channel  
- Physical test article  
- Dye visualization / PIV / flow tracers (if applicable)  
- Controlled Reynolds number regime

## Governing Physics & Assumptions

- Flow regime and dominant dimensionless parameters  
- Scaling laws and similarity assumptions  
- Expected separation / wake behavior  

---

## Measurement & Data Processing

- Instrumentation and calibration  
- Data collection methodology  
- Sources of uncertainty and error  

---

## Results

*(Insert flow visualization images or plots here)*

- Observed flow structures  
- Comparison to theoretical expectations  
- Sensitivity to flow speed / geometry  

---

## Engineering Conclusions

This experiment demonstrated the importance of physical validation when modeling complex flow behavior. The results informed design tradeoffs and highlighted where theoretical or numerical models diverged from observed reality.
