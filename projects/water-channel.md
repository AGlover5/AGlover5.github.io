## Summary

This project investigated flow behavior around a physical model in a controlled water channel environment. The goal was to characterize flow structures, validate scaling assumptions, and compare experimental results to theoretical predictions.

---

## Motivation and Relevance
Low Reynolds number fluid flow is an increasingly common regime for small UAVs and underwater drones. Prior CFD studies by Tang et al [1] suggested that corrugated airfoil geometries—motivated by dragonfly wing structures—could generate higher lift coefficients and improved lift-to-drag ratios compared to conventionally smooth, teardrop shaped NACA airfoils.
The objective of this project was to experimentally validate these predicted trends and investigate the flow mechanisms responsible for performance differences in a controlled water channel environment.

## Experimental Setup- High Level
The experimental setup was designed for rapid and repeatable iterations of the lift measurements as well as for dye visualization runs at different angles of attack.

Lift forces were converted from strain gauge measurements on the cantilever beam supporting the airfoil. A calibration curve was generated by applying known loads to the beam and mapping strain output to equivalent force. Lift coefficient was then calculated from a controlled wing area and dynamic pressure.

## Pragmatic and Economic Considerations
Since the limiting factor on the execution of the experiment was facility availability, it was decided that constructing a single adjustable angle-of-attack mechanism would cause unnecesary delays due to additional assembly time and angle tolerance verification.

The majority of the setup used beams, slots, and connectors that were already in stock at the university, leaving considerable margin for the 3D printing budget. By making smaller and simpler individual connectors for each AOA of a standard design, a  CAD connector could be duplicated for any angle, printed, and then used in a data recording trial within 1-2 days of the 3D print order being submitted.
